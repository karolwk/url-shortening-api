## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) - React component library
- [React Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - state container for JS Apps
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Redux Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist)

### What I learned

It took me a long time to finish this project, but I think it was worth it. The main goal / challenge for me was to create a style for this application only using the Material-UI library so now I feel much more comfortable using it. Also, I learn a lot new thigs about Redux Toolkit and especially RTK Query addon. RTK was very useful with eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic by myself.
